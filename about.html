      <p>I am currently in my third year at The Ohio State University, pursuing a major in Computer & Information Science and a double-minor
        in Mathematics and Music. I am from Wantagh, New York, a suburban town located on Long Island. In 2018, I graduated from Wantagh High
        School with a Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation with Honors. Additionally, I was a member of the National Honor Society, the
        National Science Honor Society, the World Language Honor Society, and the Tri-M Music Honor Society.</p>
      <p>It was my junior year of high school (2016-2017) when I first discovered my love for Computer Science. I participated with my
        school's Science Olympiad team, and one of the events I competed in was entitled "Game On", where a teammate and I had fifty minutes
        to design and implement a video game using Scratch based on an arbitary topic revealed at the start of the event. When preparing for
        this event, I enjoyed the critical thinking and problem solving skills used to quickly figure out how to program certain game mechanics,
        along with the creativity of designing game elements off random topics and adapting to the limitations of the basic Scratch framework.

      <p>//TODO - talk about what I've learned CSE-wise since then, and include some fun facts for some <i>personal flavor</i></p>
