      <p>I am currently in my third year at The Ohio State University, pursuing a major in Computer & Information Science and a double-minor
        in Mathematics and Music. I am from Wantagh, New York, a suburban town located on Long Island. In 2018, I graduated from Wantagh High
        School with a Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation with Honors. Additionally, I was a member of the National Honor Society, the
        National Science Honor Society, the World Language Honor Society, and the Tri-M Music Honor Society.</p>
      <p>It was my junior year of high school (2016-2017) when I first discovered my love for Computer Science. I participated with my
        school's Science Olympiad team, and one of the events I competed in was entitled "Game On". In this event, a teammate and I had fifty minutes
        to design and implement a video game using Scratch based on an arbitary topic revealed at the start of the event. When preparing for
        this event, I enjoyed the critical thinking and problem solving skills used to quickly figure out how to program certain game mechanics,
        along with the creativity of designing game elements off random topics and adapting to the limitations of the basic Scratch framework.
      </p>
      <p>From that moment, I decided to major in Computer Science, and I have not regretted that decision since. Currently, I am well-versed in the Java,
        C, and Ruby programming languages. I am also familiar with C++, C#, JavaScript, and MATLAB, and I am always interested in exploring new
        languages and concepts. Furthermore, I spend parts of my free time creating <a href="projects.html">practice projects</a> to improve my skills and broaden my horizons.
      </p>
      <p><img src="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~baruch.9/mask%20selfie.jpg" alt="A recent selfie of me" id="selfie"/><br />I spend the remainder of
        my time doing homework, eating food, practicing or listening to music, and playing video games. In addition, I enjoy cooking, and I play the clarinet,
        piano, and baritone horn. I can even solve a Rubik's Cube in around 20 seconds.</p>
      <p>My favorite food is cheesecake, with steak and sushi not too far behind. Another fun fact about me is that I am a member of the Ohio State
        University Marching Band, otherwise known as <i>The Best Damn Band in the Land</i>.
