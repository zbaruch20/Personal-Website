      I am currently in my third year at The Ohio State University, pursuing a major in Computer & Information Science and a double-minor in Mathematics and Music. My GPA is currently
      3.919, and I expect to graduate in May 2022. I am from Wantagh, New York, a suburban town located on Long Island. In 2018, I graduated from Wantagh High School with a
      Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation with Honors. Additionally, I was a member of the National Honor Society, the National Science Honor Society, the World Language
      Honor Society, and the Tri-M Music Honor Society.

      It was my junior year of high school (2016-2017) when I first discovered my love for Computer Science. I participated on my
      school's Science Olympiad team, and one of the events I competed in was entitled "Game On". In this event, a teammate and I had fifty minutes
      to design and implement a video game using Scratch based on an arbitary topic revealed at the start of the event. When preparing for
      this event, I enjoyed the critical thinking and problem solving skills used to quickly figure out how to program certain game mechanics,
      along with the creativity of designing game elements off random topics and adapting to the limitations of the basic Scratch framework.

  From that moment, I decided to major in Computer Science at Ohio State, and I have not regretted that decision since. Currently, I am well-versed in the Java, C#, and Ruby programming languages.
  I am also familiar with other programming languages such as C and JavaScript, and I have had prior experience with various software development tools and frameworks, including
  Bootstrap, Git, Rails, RESTful services, the UNIX operating system, and several IDEs such as Eclipse and Visual Studio. I am always interested in exploring new languages and
  concepts, spending parts of my free time creating <%= link_to 'practice projects', '../projects' %> to improve my skills and broaden my horizons.

      My main interests in Computer Science are software and web development. I personally enjoy creating interactive web applications using the latest frameworks and technologies.
      Having the freedom to design front-end graphical user interfaces allows me to showcase my personality and express my creativity while providing professional, clean code.

      When I am not busy programming, I spend my time partaking in some of my many other interests. A fun fact about myself is that I am a member of
      The Ohio State University Marching Band, also known as the <i>Best Damn Band in the Land</i>, where I play the baritone horn.
      Additionally, I also know how to play the clarinet and piano.

      Another fun fact about myself is that I can solve a Rubik's cube in 20 seconds. I also enjoy cooking and playing video games in my free time.
