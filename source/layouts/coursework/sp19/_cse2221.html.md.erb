This is the first course for the CSE/CIS major, the first of two courses in the Software Sequence.
For more information, you can access the course website [here](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/2221/web-sw1/).

In this course, we were re-introduced to the Java language, and additionally used the
[OSU CSE Components API](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/common/doc/) to assist with
learning about the use of various data structures, such as `XMLTree`, `NaturalNumber`, `Queue`, `Stack`,
`Set`, `Sequence`, and `Map`. In addition, we also delved further into prodecural and object-oriented programming
concepts, such as reference types, relationships between interfaces and classes (i.e. implements and extends),
inheritance, polymorphism, overloading, overriding, object type vs. declared type, class type vs. interface type,
static vs. instance methods, recursion, unit testing, generics, simple graphical user interfaces
using Swing, and loop invariants.

Representative project and lab assignments included:

* Write a program that computes the square root of a number using Newton iteration
* Implement methods that read from an XML file representating an arithmetic expression, and recursively evaluate the parsed expression
* Write a program that reads a glossary of terms from a text file, and generates HTML pages each containing a term and its definition,
as well as an index page containing a link to all the term pages, and links between terms inside definitions
