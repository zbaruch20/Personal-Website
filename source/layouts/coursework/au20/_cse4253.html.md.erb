Introduced to the basics of the C# programming languages, with an emphasis on
Object-Oriented Programming.

Representative projects included:

* Design and implement a class library for a scene graph, including interfaces, subclasses,
and abstract classes
    * Additionally use the visitor design model to write a program that traverses this scene graph
* Design and implement a simple graphical user interface using Xamarin and data binding that displays
information from a custom data structure representing an arbitary topic
    * For more information about this project, see *Basic Xamarin Application* under **Projects Completed for Coursework**
    in [Projects](../projects)
    * For more information about personal embellishments I made to this project, see *CSE Courses Viewer*
