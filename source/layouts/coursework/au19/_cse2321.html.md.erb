This is the first of two courses in the Foundations Sequence.

This course introduced fundamental mathematics topics used in Computer Science, including
propositional and predicate calculus, proofs by implication and contradiction, set theory,
proofs by mathematical induction, relations, functions, and introductory graph theory.
Introductory algorithm analysis was also discussed, with a focus on asymptotic notation and
calculating the time complexity of basic algorithms containing branching, while loops, for
loops, and simple recursion.

Algorithms of focus included:

* MergeSort
* Breadth-First Search and its applications
* Depth-First Search and its applications
