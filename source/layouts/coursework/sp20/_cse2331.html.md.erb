This is the second of two courses in the Foundations Sequence.

This course embellished on previous topics taught in CSE 2221, and explored the theory and uses of various data structures and algorithms.
In addition, probablistic algorithms and linear programming topics were discussed.

Algorithms of focus included:

* The Selection Problem
* QuickSort
* Minimal-Spanning Trees (Kruskal, Prim)
* Binary Search Trees, Red-Black Trees
* Single-Source Lightest Path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
* Closest Pairs (Sweep-Line/Plane Sweep)
* Linear Programming Problems and their applications
* Hamiltonian Paths
* Traveling Salesperson Problem
